## Contributions
Benjamin Kuo - Collaborated with Raghav on the calorie tracking page by designing and implementing the add button. Created a ring pie chart using zingchart with a matching color scheme to fit the dynamic of our app and displayed the users’ macros for a single day.   

Chenghao Li - Worked on the backend of setting up add recipe and cookbook features. Connect to the front end page and change some minor styling problems of the front end page.

Baijun Chen - Worked on frontend. Wrote several test cases with Yinghui, Xinchen, Jackie and Eric using jest and puppeteer. Added text to signup and login page while fixed one bug where recipe cards on the landing page were not showing at the correct position. Took notes for several meetings. Tried to add multiple carousels on the landing page  Helped Jackie and Yinghui to implement the landing page. 


Mingkai Li - Worked on backend routes for cookbook, and calorie tracker, added database model functions to get, delete, and update new recipes. Made database migrations for the different tables that exist in the database. Set up continuous development with AWS codepipeline along with source and deploy artifacts with ElasticBeanstalk.  

Eric Peng - worked on frontend, including landing page and the design logistics of our features, such as the front end design of the pie chart calorie tracker and saving recipe pages, making sure the CSS/features matches our design. Also worked on video submissions and other team logistics. 

Jackie Kwok - Fixed the styling of the recipe page by formatting the overflowing CSS grid and by making the page responsive for smaller screens and mobile devices. Collaborated with Baijun, Yinghui, Xinchen, and Eric on starting some test cases. Helped format the columns of the grid on the calorie tracking page. (There was a bug where the columns either kept running off the screen or were shrinking. ) Also helped with lining up the recipe cards on the calorie tracking page. Worked on adding a clickable bookmark icon to recipe cards (frontend). 

Yinghui Sun - Worked on the frontend calorie count tracker page. Fixed a bug where recipe card images were not displaying correctly. Also assigned to write test cases with  Jackie, Baijun, and Xinchen using jest to test the functionality of the website and backend.


Aditya Moghe -  Worked on fixing the backend for login  and signup feature of web application. Worked on the substring filtering of stored recipes as well as search functionality for said queries. Minor change to password confirmation was made as well. Made some edge cases for user input when the user creates an account to make sure duplicates do not exist.


Xinchen Zhang - worked on the frontends team and implemented the calorie calculator feature to calculate how many calories the user needs to take per day and connected it to the project. Fixed bugs for the modify recipe page. Improved the coding style. Wrote some test cases with Jackie, Baijun, Yinghui to test the website. 


Allan Sun - Worked with the frontend team and coded the login page, the sign up page. I also worked with Raghav on distributing tasks and planning on steps we need to take. I also worked with Mingkai and Raghav on the CI/CD pipeline. Together we have figured out all the linting parts, Codacy code analysis, code coverage, JSdoc, and Jest. I also spend a fair amount of time troubleshooting the CI/CD pipeline. I ran into problems with Codacy code coverage and tried to resolve it, but the attempt was unsuccessful. I later experimented with Report LCOV and finally decided to use CodeCov to achieve that.


Raghav Cherukuru -  I worked on distributing tasks within the frontend team. I kept track of my other team members' progress and also helped manage teams that were working on different features. I also worked on the CI/CD pipeline with Allan integrating a linter with superlinter, code quality tool with codacy, jsdocs, jest and coverage. For the coverage we used CodeClimate and Codacy but it did not work. In addition to this, I also worked on the frontend the calorie tracking feature page with Benjamin. I worked on the add button’s javascript and css and also created the recipe card in the calorie tracking feature page.


We planned to implement the two remaining domain specific features, search bar, a little bit of styling and the filter function in sprint 2. By the end of sprint 2 we finished 95% of the work.
