## Contributions
Benjamin Kuo - I worked on frontend development pertaining to the recipe page with Raghav and found some existing code for our timer that we can build off of.  

Chenghao Li - I wrote one ADR for our team API. Worked on the frontend, implementing the cookbook page by using HTML and CSS. The cookbook page includes name, steps, ingredients and some other things. Will be working on backend also to support the add and delete recipe feature.  

Baijun Chen - I worked on the frontend, and I helped implement the carousel/slideshow functionality on our landing page using HTML and CSS. i also helped implement the recipe cards with other frontend teammates. I managed to fix the arrow button and the size of the carousel part on the screen. I took notes of several group meetings. I’ve been attending every standup meetings and brainstorming meetings.

Mingkai Li - I worked on setting up and attaching the relational MySQL database on AWS RDS to our codebase, created basic functionality of inserting and getting from database. Besides that, I also created backend routes for signup and login in order to facilitate frontend features.  

Eric Peng - I worked on the design team and created from scratch the figma mid fidelity prototype, as well as the high fidelity prototype wireframes, also while i was contributing to the designs, i was in close connections with the front end team and helped on the architecture of the site. I also helped build our projects landing page as well as the basic feature pages by providing the HTML, CSS to the front end landing page.  

Jackie Kwok - I wrote two of our ADRs. I worked with members of our frontend team to build our project’s home page. On the home page, I helped implement the recipe cards from our design using HTML and CSS. I also helped implement the sliding functionality of the cards on the home page of our project.

Yinghui Sun - I worked on the frontend. I helped create recipe cards html+css elements with other frontend team members. I created the navigation bar for the landing page. I centered the elements in the webpage using flexbox and css tweaks so that zooming out in the web page does not break the webpage. I planned on building templates that can be used for every page of our figma mockup, and I believe I fully achieved that. Demo: https://www.loom.com/share/9fba958ff53149da882b96d416793448  

Aditya Moghe - I worked on the backend side of our project utilizing mySequel for our relational database. One main task I took on along with Thomas was the get/login feature of our application. I additionally created a password confirmation check to confirm that the user has created a usable password. The signup and login backend side of the project was the majority of what I took on.  

Xinchen Zhang - I worked on the frontend with Chenghao Li, and we created the cook book part for users to add or delete their own recipes. The recipes user entered will be added to the database, and we will implement this feature later.  

Allan Sun - I worked on defining, creating and assigning tasks to the team and I worked on implementing the CI/CD pipeline. I also worked with Thomas on redesigning the frontend as well as setting up the database.  

Raghav Cherukuru - I worked on the frontend creating a single recipe page with Benjamin Kuo. We also implemented a timer on this page.  I also worked on setting up the CI/CD pipeline with Allan Sun.  

We finished 60 percent of the work. Overall we finished 80 percent by the end of sprint 1.
