## Analysis of Different Recipe Websites
* Simply
    * Good
        * Recipes give tips on what to prepare
        * Ability to save recipes
        * Holiday tab
        * Recipes tailored around tools and ingredients
        * Estimated cooking time
        * Cards on home page contain image, name, rating, and category
    * Bad
        * Long page load times
        * Navbar has too many tabs
        * ‘Quick tab’ can be combined with ‘Recipes by Time & Ease’
        * Random banner that says to meet the team at Simply in between recipes
* Allrecipes
    * Good
        * Easy to navigate navbar
        * Search by ingredient
    * Bad
        * Super long and cluttered home page
        * Lots of ads/pop-ups
* Food.com
    * Good
        * Beginner oriented (doesn’t have too many categories)
        * Trending recipes that shows 5 recipes but it has a “view all” tab so that the user can see more recipes
        * Links inside the ingredients list that tell you what the ingredient is
        * Has a button that allows you to buy the ingredients online from Ralphs
    * Bad
        * Since the recipes are laid out horizontally, you have to scroll down the page to see each category
* Myrecipes
    * Good
        * Checklist of ingredients
        * Print button which allows you to print out the most essential parts of the recipe. Also has the option to change the font size of the printable page. 
    * Bad
        * The steps are hard to read. 
* Epicurious
    * Good
        * Allows you to buy ingredients from Amazon.
        * Has cards on the home page that feature recipes. These cards are uniform so they can be used repeatedly.  
        * App has a built-in timer, but the timer is for the cooking time of the entire recipe and it can't be adjusted. If we want to implement a timer into our own app, we could make it adjustable for different steps of the recipe. 
    * Bad
        * Recipes are more like food blogs than actual recipes. 
        * When you search up a dish, the search results show a mix of recipes, articles, and galleries
        * Does not have a good performance score in Lighthouse. Searching for something takes a while. 
        * Has a large unrelated ad on the home page. 
        * When you misspell a word in your search, you get a failed search. It shouldn’t be this strict because people misspell all the time. 
* UCSD & UCLA Dining Hall Sites
    * Good
        * A nutrition label is shown on the side. When you edit the ingredients, the nutrition label updates in realtime. 
        * Has information about dietary restrictions. 

## Miro Board
* https://miro.com/welcome/WXVoa2ZWTG9tbllERGpqcDNMUTFEZ24xaE1xZVdFSXV0MklITjhsbWRTbFVVSWpWM0xOMXJ2WU5PSDF3Z05GcHwzMDc0NDU3MzY2MTgzMzIxNDMz?invite_link_id=808849385017 
* We each posted our individual brainstorming notes on the board. 

## More Brainstorming
* Login system that uses cookies or local storage
* Social media version of a recipe site
    * People post pictures and the recipes of stuff they cook, and other people can like, comment, and repost. 
    * People post their own recipes so we wouldn’t be pulling from a separate recipe database. 

## To-do List
* Push our brainstorming material to repo
* Project pitch
