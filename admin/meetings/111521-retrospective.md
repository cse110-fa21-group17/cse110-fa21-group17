## Mad (things that frustrated you in the last iteration)

> I wish I had more time to focus onto this project and this project only
> 

> Since our time is limited, we always had to take up time during our meetings or outside of our meetings to complete assignments.
> 

> Work from other classes hindered my ability to dedicate as much time as I would've liked
> 

> feeling overwhelmed with bugs
> 

> During meetings sometimes I'm the only one talking (or there are just one or two guys that would respond to me), I feel like I'm being ignored
> 

## Sad (things that disappointed you in the last iteration)

> There isn't enough communication among different teams/devs.
> 

> I feel some of the more design issues should have been addressed earlier
> 

> Lot of deadlines and gotta work on other classes too
> 

> There are always some small bugs and some of them are not easy to fix.
> 

> Sad that some of the back end features I wanted to work on weren't completed.
> 

> pull request descriptions not being detailed enough
Project boards aren't being used enough
> 

## Glad (things that excited you in the last iteration)

> The team leaders are very professional, and make us on the right track.
> 

> Thomas was able to help us with a lot of the things I don't know how to do
> 

> Glad that I'm learning new things
> 

> All the teammates have contributed to the project
> 

> We agree with most if not all the designs
>
