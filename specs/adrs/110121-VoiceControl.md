# Decision to use Voice Control
* Status: rejected

## Context and Problem Statement
If users are following a recipe while cooking, they probably don't want to touch their device because their hands could be dirty or not free. We can address this problem by allowing users to navigate the screen using voice commands. 

## Considered Options
* Implement voice control using some kind of API
* Don't implement voice control

## Decision Outcome
We decided to reject the idea of implementing voice control because of the limited time that we have to develop the project. We would've had to spend time learnign how to implement it and we would've had to spend more time testing it. It could also be difficult to implement voice control cross platform.  

We also realized that kitchen could be noisy, so our app might have trouble picking up the user's voice.
